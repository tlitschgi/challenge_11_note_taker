Note Taker

The purpose of the Note Taker application allows the user to view, create and delete notes.  

When the application is invoked, the first page will appear indicating the user is in the Note Taker application.  A 'Get Started' button is clickable to navigate the user to the actual Note Taker page where the notes can be viewed, created and deleted. 

When the user navigates to the Note Tasker note entry page, a button to add a new note is located at the upper right hand corner.  After clicking the New Note button, the user then can enter the Note Title and Note Text.  When the user begins to enter the text, the 
Save Note and Clear Form buttons will appear in the upper right hand corner.

After the note is saved, the note title will appear on the left hand side.  Also, a trash can appears next to the note title to allow for the note to be deleted.

To invoke the application, go to the VS terminal and enter:
node server.js,
The terminal will respond with the following:
Server is running on http://localhost:3001. 
Copy "http://localhost:3001" and go to the browser, enter the url and press enter.
